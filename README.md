# **LumenAI Data Engineering Toolkit**

The **AI Data Engineering Toolkit** simplifies and accelerates the preparation of data for machine learning pipelines. It provides automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline generation, data quality assessment using AI, and seamless integration with data lakes and warehouses. This toolkit is designed for data engineers and machine learning practitioners who want to streamline their data workflows efficiently and effectively.

## **Key Features**

1. **Automated ETL Pipeline Generation**
   - Build end-to-end ETL pipelines with minimal effort.
   - Modular architecture allows easy customization for specific requirements.
   - Designed to handle structured and semi-structured data.

2. **AI-Powered Data Quality Assessment**
   - Evaluate the quality of datasets using advanced AI-driven techniques.
   - Identify missing values, anomalies, and other quality issues automatically.
   - Generate quality reports to ensure your data is ML-ready.

3. **Seamless Integration**
   - Connect with popular data lakes and warehouses like Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, and Azure Data Lake.
   - Built-in modules for managing data at scale with cloud-native support.

4. **Rust-Powered Performance**
   - Leverages the speed and memory efficiency of Rust.
   - Provides highly reliable and robust pipelines with a focus on safety.

## **Why Use the AI Data Engineering Toolkit?**

- **Simplified Workflows**: Automates repetitive tasks so you can focus on insights rather than operations.
- **High Performance**: Built in Rust for speed, reliability, and scalability.
- **Flexibility**: Extensible design allows for easy integration into existing data workflows.
- **AI Insights**: Identify and resolve data quality issues before they impact your models.

## **Usage**

### **1. Building an ETL Pipeline**
Below is an example of how to create a simple ETL pipeline:

```rust
use ai_data_engineering_toolkit::{ETLBuilder, DataQuality};

fn main() {
    let etl_pipeline = ETLBuilder::new()
        .extract("data/input.csv")
        .transform(|data| {
            println!("Transforming data: {:?}", data);
        })
        .load("data/output.csv")
        .build();

    etl_pipeline.run();
    println!("ETL Pipeline executed successfully!");

    let quality_report = DataQuality::assess("data/output.csv");
    println!("Data Quality Report: {:?}", quality_report);
}
```

### **2. Assessing Data Quality**
Use the `DataQuality` module to evaluate datasets:
```rust
use ai_data_engineering_toolkit::quality::DataQuality;

fn main() {
    let report = DataQuality::assess("data/output.csv");
    println!("Data Quality Report: {}", report);
}
```
